1. Watch: Defiance and anger on the streets of LA
A second day of protests and unrest took place on Saturday as residents of a predominantly Latino district of Los Angels clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal agents.  Officers used tear gas and batons to disperse crowds in the Paramount district.  US President Donald Trump has said 2,000 National Guardsmen would be deployed to California to deal with the protests, which were sparked by raids targeting undocumented migrants.  California Governor Gavin Newsom called the move was "purposefully inflammatory" and said it would inflame tensions. 

2. Trump-Musk row heightens fears over Nasa budget cuts
The row between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over a major spending bill has exacerbated uncertainty over the future of Nasa's budget, which is facing deep cuts.  The space agency has published its budget request to Congress, which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half. Forty science missions, which are in development or in space already, are in line to be stood down. The president has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, Space X. Nasa relies on the firm's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to resupply the International Space Station with crew and supplies. The space agency also expects to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars once it has been developed. Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University said that the uncertainty was having a "chilling impact" on the human space programme.

3. Italian citizenship referendum polarises country
Sonny Olumati was born in Rome and has lived in Italy all his life but the country he calls home does not recognise him as its own. To Italy, Sonny is Nigerian, like his passport, and the 39-year-old is only welcome as long as his latest residence permit. "I've been born here. I will live here. I will die here," the dancer and activist tells me in what he calls "macaroni" Italian-English beneath the palm trees of a scruffy Roman park. "But not having citizenship is like... being rejected from your country. And I don't think this is a feeling we should have". That is why Sonny and others have been campaigning for a "Yes" vote in a national referendum on Sunday and Monday that proposes halving the time required to apply for Italian citizenship.

4. Doctors trialling 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs
UK doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces. The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria. Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year. The focus is on the bowels which are "the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals.

5. Bowen: Israel is accused of the gravest war crimes - how governments respond could haunt them for years
Even wars have rules. They don't stop soldiers killing each other but they're intended to make sure that civilians caught up in the fighting are treated humanely and protected from as much danger as possible. The rules apply equally to all sides. If one side has suffered a brutal surprise attack that killed hundreds of civilians, as Israel did on 7 October 2023, it does not get an exemption from the law. The protection of civilians is a legal requirement in a battle plan. That, at least, is the theory behind the Geneva Conventions. The latest version, the fourth, was formulated and adopted after World War Two to stop such slaughter and cruelty to civilians from ever happening again. At the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva (ICRC) the words "Even Wars Have Rules" are emblazoned in huge letters on a glass rotunda.  The reminder is timely because the rules are being broken.
